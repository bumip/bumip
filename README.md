# bumip

Bumip is a modern tool for web development. Is not a framework and is not a CMS.
It is an IDT (Integrated Development Tool) built around 4 main principles:

* Every developer has its own style, we will give guidelines, not rules.
* Patterns are continuosly criticized from other parties and tend to become obsolete. We want to get the best from the most popular patterns and concepts.
* KISS: Keep it simple stupid! We want our codebase to be easy to maintain and we want to get you to work as fast as possible.
* Building a real tool to create a real product (not just an API but a complete product) is our main priority. Bumip comes with beautiful customizable UI to kickstart your next creation.
