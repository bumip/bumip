# bumip

Bumip is a modern tool for web development. Is not a framework and is not a CMS.
It is an IDT (Integrated Development Tool) built around 3 main principles:

Every developer has its own style, we will give guidelines, not rules.
Patterns are continuosly criticized from other parties and tend to become obsolete. We want to get the best from the most popular patterns and concepts.
KISS: Keep it simple stupid! We want our codebase to be easy to maintain and we want to get you to work as fast as possible.
